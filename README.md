This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The Tom Spaulding Home Page.
This is the site I use to run experiments, store various bookmarks/tools, try new frameworks, and generally anything 
I would like to show off to a client or in an interview.

The site can be found live at [tomspaulding.co.nf](http://tomspaulding.co.nf/)

* `git clone` obviously one needs to pull the repo
* `npm install` navigate to root directory and npm install, if you don't have npm then you need to install node

## Running

As of right now just simply

* 'npm start' to start the app locally

## Current Tech Used

* [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Code Mirror](https://codemirror.net/)
